          <h2>Me!</h2>
          <p>Sophie Lorraine Smith is a poet and author living in Western Washington.
            They were Kenmore’s first Youth Poet Laureate, the winner of the 2023 Queer Writers of America contest, and their work has been published in Queerbook, Under the Madness Magazine, Good Word Walking, and New Worlds Press- so far.
            Their poetry is comprehensible and accessible to people who don’t read poetry, while still being profound and speaking to complicated emotional experiences.
            They haven’t published any novels yet, but they plan on changing that.
            Their debut poetry collection, “The Freshman Blues,” is releasing in a few months! On a given day, you can find them reading, petting their cats, thinking about bread, making awful puns, and wearing blindingly colorful outfits.
